<div class="introduction">
  <h1>Hey there, I'm Larissa üëãüèΩ</h1>

  <p>According to an expensive piece of paper, I'm employable as a <b>software developer</b>.
    I prefer to think of myself as a <b>people-first problem-solver</b> whose solutions sometimes
      involve writing code.
  </p>
  <p>In particular, <b>I excel at taking vague business requirements with many stakeholders and distilling them into technical proposals with well-defined tradeoffs</b>.
      I'm not too bad with the execution, either!
  </p>

  <p>I recently finished a 5-year tenure with the <b><a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/" target="_blank">Wealthsimple</a></b> team making financial services more accessible for everyone. I've worked on everything from launching in a new region, to onboarding, to trade execution, to cloud infrastructure. Before working at Wealthsimple, I interned at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, & <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a>.<div class=""></div></p>

  <p>Most of my free time is spent thinking about democratic citizenship, privacy rights, & other matters that affect society at large. Right now, I'm particularly interested in the sociology of tech & algorithmic bias.</p>

  <p>As a hobbyist musician & producer, I put aside a few hours each week<br>
    to <a href="/listening_log" target="_blank">give new music my full attention</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="/reading_list" target="_blank">I also enjoy reading</a> pretty much everything <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/culture/2010-dobelli.pdf" target="_blank">other than the news.</a></p>
