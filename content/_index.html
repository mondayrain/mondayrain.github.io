<div class="introduction">
  <h1>hey there üëãüèΩ</h1>

  <br/>
  <p>I'm a born & raised Vancouverite, recently returned home after spending 5 exciting years in Toronto.</p>

  <p>According to an expensive piece of paper, I'm employable as a <b>software developer</b>.
    I prefer to think of myself as a <b>people-first problem-solver</b> whose solutions sometimes
      involve writing code.
  </p>
  <p><b>I excel at taking vague business requirements</b> (or complicated operations)
      with multiple stakeholders, <b>and distilling them into technical proposals with well-defined tradeoffs</b>.
      I'm not too bad with the execution, either!
  </p>

  <p>I recently finished a 5-year tenure with the <b><a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/" target="_blank">Wealthsimple</a></b> team making financial services more accessible for everyone. Joining when the company was less then 100 people, I worked on everything from launching the UK product, to the onboarding pipeline, to trade order execution, to transitioning to the Infrastructure Platform team. Before working at Wealthsimple, I had brief dalliances with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.demonware.net/" target="_blank">Demonware</a>, & <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a><div class=""></div> <b>I'm currently taking a wellness break before jumping back in</b>.

  <p>
      I try to run on my life on two axioms:
      <ul>
          <li>Nothing is mutually exclusive</li>
          <li>The best opinions are thoroughly formed, but weakly held</li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Most of my free time is spent thinking about democratic citizenship, sustainable living, health care, privacy rights, & other matters that affect society at large. Right now, I'm particularly interested in the sociology of tech and algorithmic bias.</p>

  <p>As a hobbyist musician & producer, I put aside a few hours each week<br>
    to <a href="/listening_log" target="_blank">give new music my full attention</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="/reading_list" target="_blank">I also read a lot</a> of fiction, non-fiction, & long-form journalism. <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/culture/2010-dobelli.pdf" target="_blank">I don't read the news.</a></p>
