<i>"Do not listen with the intent to reply,
<br/>but with the intent to understand."</i>

Each week I try to put aside some time to just sit and listen closely to a record. I never listen to music with the intent of deciding whether a song/album is "good" or "bad", or even to see if I "like" it. Rather, I'm interested in hearing different approaches to production, processing, audio engineering, & songwriting. I try hard not to discriminate by genre.

Here are some albums that I ended up playing on repeat:
