<i>"There are worse crimes than burning books.
<br/>One of them is not reading them."
<br/>- Ray Bradbury</i>

I read a lot. I read as much as I can. I read in an attempt to truly understand how the world and the beings within it work, which - given that nothing is mutually exclusive - means that I try read everything.
